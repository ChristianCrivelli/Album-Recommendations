"""
One-off backfill (issue #14's tag-guarantee prerequisite): try Spotify
artist genres for every album that currently has zero tags. As of
2026-08-29 that's 195 albums — a mix of MusicBrainz successes that came
back with no tags, and older rows from before this pipeline tried as hard
as it does now. The ongoing pipeline (album_push_logic.py /
spotify_client.apply_spotify_fallback) now tries this automatically for
new albums going forward; this script is just to clear the existing gap
in one pass, which is what #14's "every card shows 1-3 tags" needs before
it can ship without surfacing a wall of blank tag rows.

Run locally once, after adding real spotify_id/spotify_key to your .env:
    python -m src.ingestion.backfill_tags

Safe to re-run — anything Spotify still has no genres for is left
untagged, unchanged, for a manual tag pass later.
