    """Maps lower-cased title -> {id, title} for every album already in
    Supabase. Used to batch the nightly rating/timestamp refresh via a single
    upsert keyed on id (the primary key, so no new unique constraint is
    needed) instead of one UPDATE ... WHERE title = ... round-trip per row.
    The DB's own title is carried along so the refresh upsert can round-trip
    it back untouched — see the comment on refresh_records below for why
    that's necessary even though this refresh never intends to change title.

    PAGINATED: PostgREST (Supabase's REST layer) silently caps a single
    .select() at 1000 rows — no error, no truncation flag, it just stops.
    This table crossed 1000 rows at some point after this function was
    first written, and every run since then was quietly missing the tail
    end of it. Whichever albums fell outside the first 1000 looked "new" to
    the is_new check below, got needlessly re-sent through get_metadata()
    every single night (wasted MusicBrainz calls, longer runtime), and —
    now that matching is exact-only (see album_finder.py) — sometimes
    failed to re-match under the stricter rules and landed in
    failed_lookups looking like a real data problem, even though the
    existing row was already correct (2026-08-22: this is what "Section
    80", "Who Cares", "Sugar Papi", "After da Boat", and a few others
    turned out to be — not bad Notion data, just this function forgetting
    they existed). Paginating in PAGE_SIZE chunks via .range() — the same
    fix pull_albums.py already applies to the Notion side — makes sure
    every row is actually seen, however many there now are."""
